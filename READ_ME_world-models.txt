February 2016

****************  This library is downloaded from simheaven.com  ****************

*********************************************************************************
This is a a adapted version from world-models available from world2xplane.com.
It should work with all other w2xp sceneries available, even the PRO versions.
There are some minor changes: fixed LOD errors, increased LODs for some objects, 
converted png files to dds, commented out red lights for powerline towers and 
smaller wind turbines and corrected few other things.

world2xplane is a fantastic tool by Tony to generate scenery date from OSM data. 
For more information about world2xplane please refer to Tonys website world2xplane.com

OSM data is provided by geofabrik.de (Feb 2016) and a lot of users in the world doing the input
for free. Please help and improve your region, visit openstreetmap.org for more details.

This is a very short management summary with the most important things! ;)
If you like the work, think about a donation to Tony, OSM, SimHeaven or any other freeware author.

Installing is easy, copy the content of the archive to your custom scenery folder and after starting
and ending X-Plane, adjust the order of entries in scenery_packs.ini, refer to FAQ at simheaven.com:
